SHN Rating for SAW 2 Flesh and Blood üëªüëªüëª The Game Continues ! Saw 2 takes place right after the ending of the first Saw Game! Can we survive Jigsaws 
Before I begin I should say that I am a huge fan of the movies. I own them and have seen them multiple times. I beat the first game and am very close the to beating the second. And my first impressions is that they were close to capturing the feel of being in one of Jigsaw‚Äôs ‚Äúgames‚Äù. They have the look down for the traps, abandoned warehouses and apartments, the timers, and most of all Jigsaw himself who they got the real actor to voice act in the game. Unfortunately most of the Games feels. –ü–∞—Ä–º–µ–ª–∏—è - —Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∞ –∏–∑ –¥–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –ù–µ–¥–∞–≤–Ω–æ —è —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ –∑–∞–±–æ–ª–µ–ª–∞ - –∫–∞—à–µ–ª—å, —Å–ª–∞–±–æ—Å—Ç—å. –ü–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–∞ –æ—Ç—Å—ã–ø–∞–ª–∞ –º–Ω–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∏, —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑—É—è –µ–µ –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –∫–∞–∫ –ø–∞–Ω–∞—Ü–µ—é, –∞ —è –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ —Å–ª—ã—à–∞–ª–∞ –æ –Ω–µ–π. SAW II brings back Jigsaw's gruesome traps as players must find ways to survive. I've always thought that both these games were some of the best horror titles on offer for the PS3. Saw in particularly, was an extremely tense game, with a solid story and great visuals. From memory, I remember reading somewhere that Konami wanted the series to be their next big thing and a spiritual successor to the Silent Hill games. Nowadays however, you hardly hear anyone talk about either of them. I did a quick eBay search and both command reasonably high prices, perhaps suggesting –ú—ã –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ–º –≤–∞–º —Å–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å Saw 2: Flesh and Blood (2010) —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º –æ—Ç –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤.

I think it will be Jaime Lannister and here is why. For a long time, I have assumed that if any of the Lannisters would survive it would be Tyrion in a kind of final ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to Tywin. I wouldn‚Äôt mind at all for ShowTyrion to survive, he is a pretty decent guy. But if ShowTyrion survives it stands to reason that his book counterpart who has become pretty dark in ADWD would survive as well and I‚Äôm not sure that GRRM would do that.
